class FACSUnmixer(object):

    def __init__(self, xref, yref, xs, ys, offset_guess, offset_bounds, fit_window):
        '''
        This class 'unmixes' a sample FACS distribution using a reference
        (negative-control) distribution.

        By 'unmixing', we mean identifying and removing the portion
        of the sample distribution that corresponds to the GFP-negative population.
        This is not as straightforward as simply subtracting a reference distribution
        from the sample distribution, because 1) the mean intensity of the GFP-negative population
        shifts (by ~10 percent) from sample to sample, due to biological variability,
        and 2) the magnitude of the GFP-negative peak in the sample distribution
        depends on the magnitude of the GFP-positive peak.

        To address these complexities, the unmixing is accomplished by 'fitting'
        a reference distribution to the left-hand 'side' of the sample distribution.

        'Fitting' means finding the offset and scale of the reference distribution
        that yields the best match between the left-hand side of the sample and reference
        distributions. We only consider the left-hand side of the distributions
        because this region corresponds to cells that are almost certainly GFP-negative;
        in some cases, GFP-positive cells are only marginally brighter than GFP-negative cells,
        leading to a subtle 'shoulder' on the *right-hand* side of the sample distribution,
        that we want to avoid fitting the reference distribution
        (especially because this shoulder is, in fact, the density that we hope to isolate
        by subtracting the fitted reference distribution).

        Parameters
        ----------
        xref, yref : the x and y values of the mean-subtracted reference distribution
        xs, ys : the x and y values of the sample distribution
        offset_guess : initial guess for the offset parameter;
            should be equal to the reference mean
        offset_bounds : min/max bounds for the offset parameter;
            should be given by the reference mean +/- the reference standard deviation.
        fit_window : the bounds of the left-hand 'side' of the sample distribution,
            as a tuple of (x_min, x_max). Should generally be (0, ref_mean + ref_std).
